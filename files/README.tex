These implementations of the file sharing server are provided for the
purpose of testing your implementation of the file-sharing client.

The files that the server will serve are to be located in the /files
subdirectory.

You start the program by:

   server-app-MacOS start -port <port_number> [-drop] [-shuffle]

or
 
   server-app-Linux start -port <port_number> [-drop] [-shuffle]

The argument -drop will cause the server to drop some chunks,
allowing you to test that your client will properly request 
retransmissions.

The argument -shuffle will cause the server to send the chunks
out of order, allowing you to test that your client will properly
reorder chunks.
